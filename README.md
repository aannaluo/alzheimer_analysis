# Alzheimer's Analysis

Dementia is a progressive condition associated with brain atrophy and aging, involving widespread neuropsychological deficits that significantly hinder daily activities (Reuben et. al, 2010). Our project focuses on Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Unfortunately, AD has neither definitive diagnosis nor cure (Ash, 2007). Consequently, the early detection and prevention of AD by examining signs such as shrinkage in brain matter is essential for healthy aging.

The current paper hypothesizes that patients with Alzheimer’s Disease will have significantly lower mean total brain volume compared to non-Alzheimer’s disease patients above the age of 60. We will not perform hypothesis testings on scale parameters (e.g., standard deviation) as we do not intend to examine the difference in variation between the two groups.

We analyze the dataset Dementia Classification: Compare Classifiers from Kaggle.com (Deepak N, 2018), estimating the population mean difference and the variability of the sampling distribution in a series of exploratory data analysis before hypothesis testing. Our null-hypothesis states that there is no difference between the two groups. If we observe a significantly lower brain volume, similar neuro-imaging techniques may be applicable for detecting early signs of AD in clinical settings.

The current dataset originally comes from the MRI Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-2, 2009) which collects patient information using magnetic resonance imaging to investigate possible biomarkers of AD. This dataset consists of 15 variables and 373 rows, sampling from 150 participants of age 60-96 longitudinally. It characterizes whether participants have AD or not (coded Demented and Nondemented).
